A Home Screen with three lists Hotspots, Events and Attractions all of them returned from an API.

The App contains a custom nav bar and custom tabbar.

Home Screen contains a Button (BellMan Button) to show and hide floatoing button with animation.

Using AlamoFire to manages the network requests and get data from URL.

SwiftyJSON for json data parsing

For image loading I used Kingfisher library.

And FanMenu to show buttons menu for the BellMan Button.
